# A simple Website that shows movies using TMDB API.
# [Click Here For Deployed Version](https://react-tmdb-peach.vercel.app/)

This was a task in a react course, and the requirements were as follows:
* Use the API provided by TMDB to get trending movies and TV shows.
* Use **client-side filtration** to filter API response into *Movies* and *TV Shows*.
* Use **server-side filtration** to search for movies.

This project was done with React.js, using custom hooks, and without using Redux as it was unnecessary.
The website is responsive and is styled using React Bootstrap

# Changelog:
* Fixed a bug where the search and filter functions wouldn't work together at the same time.
* Improved navbar DOM structure to prevent nesting of anchor tags (resultant from using Bootstrap navbar with router links).
* Improved components' structure to increase the useability and independence of components.
* Improved responsiveness of the media details page.
